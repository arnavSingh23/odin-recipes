        <h2>Description</h2>
             <p>
                My Chicken Carbonara has tender chicken, crispy pancetta and spaghetti all tossed together in a rich, silky sauce.
                No cream is needed to get that thick creamy sauce. I’ll show you how to ensure the egg doesn’t scramble too.
                A fantastic version of the classic carbonara – so great for date night!
